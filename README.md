### 👋 Hey there, I'm Julian Barrera!

🖥️ My journey into the world of coding began with Roblox Studio, where I Lua to create games. I consider myself a new programmer as I know the basics but not enough to create fully complex programs.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring all the ways I can expand on my skills. I currently know two languages which are Lua and Python.

🎵 My favorite thing to do while doing things is play music. It allows me to focus on the tasks at hand and help keep me calm.

📚 While I am self-taught up to this point, I'm enrolling into College to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

🌟 I am open to connecting with others to build ourselves up!
