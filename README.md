### Hey, I'm Julian 👋🏼

I'm a 17-year-old programmer in the United States. 

🖥️ My coding journey began with Roblox Studio, where I used Lua to create games. I expanded from that to where I am currently learning Python.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring all the ways I can expand on my skills. I currently know two languages which are Lua and Python.

🎵 My favorite thing to do while doing things is play music. It allows me to focus on the tasks at hand and help keep me calm.

📚 While I am self-taught up to this point, I'm enrolling into College to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

🌟 I am open to connecting with others to build ourselves up!
