### Hey, I'm Julian 👋🏼

I'm a 17-year-old programmer in the United States. 

My coding journey began with Roblox Studio, where I used Lua to create games. I expanded from that to where I am currently learning Python.

## 📦 Toolbox
Currently, I'm exploring all the ways I can expand on my skills. 

**Languages I Know**
  - Python
  - Lua

## ✨ Fun Facts 
  - My favorite show is The Walking Dead
  - I love to listen to music
  - My favorite NFL team are the Arizona Cardinals

📚 While I am self-taught up to this point, I'm enrolling into College to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

🌟 I am open to connecting with others to build ourselves up!
